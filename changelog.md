## Initial Release

- Ability to add custom games to the launcher (useful for things like adding education edition)

## Planned

- Open log button in launcher settings
- Open logs directory button in launcher settings

## Incomplete

- Icon setting (icons can currently be changed through the games.json file, but I plan to add an edit setting for them)
